How To USE:

	1. Main script is GetPlots.sh

	2. To know the various options for the script do
		./GetPlots.sh -h
	   This will tell you the various option and what it does.

	3. To get the profile plots and x positions for various run do
		./GetPlots.sh -r
	   
	   This script will automatically ask you the initial and final run numbers.
	   and give  you the ppt with name ppt_R<#InitialRunNumber>_R<#FinalRunNumber>.pdf

	4. You can change the file BeamProfile.C as per your need. Or you can put some other macro that give us plots but for that you need to make few changes. I will later describe how to make that changes or I will try to make it more user friendly so that  we don't need to change much.
